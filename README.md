# quaternion-rotation

# About The Project
Script allows you to rotate a quaternion by XYZ Euler (so rotation about local target axes) angles and produces new quaternion.

# Built With
Python 3.8.0

# Getting started
### Requirements

All required packages in requirements.txt file.

To install all required packages, type "_pip install -r requirements.txt_" in the terminal.

### Working with pdf-processing:
1. At the top of the file, input the quaternion you want to rotate in _quaternionToRotate_ variable.
2. Input also the angle matrix to _angleMatrix_ variable.
3. Run the script.
4. After successful execution, program should print simple rotations and after that, the desired rotation.

# Usage
Script comes in handy in robot programming, when you have no other way of rotating a robot target.
